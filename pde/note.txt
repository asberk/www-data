Couldn't get moving-lines.html to load properly.

This file attempts to load linessandbox.pde, Line.pde and
Track.pde. These files are used only by moving-lines.html and by no
other files (at the time of this writing). 

As a result I never bothered trying to get grob-sandbox to work
(unfortunately). It might be worth seeing if the files in
www-data/Processing/Grob/ are functional; otherwise, just scp the
local files from Sketches/ProjMap/grob-sandbox/.
