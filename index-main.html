	  <h2> 
	    About Me
	  </h2>
	  <p> I completed my M.Sc. Mathematics in August 2014 at
	    the University of Toronto. My supervisor was
	    <a href="http://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/nachman-a/">Dr. Adrian Nachman</a>, under whom I researched fast
	    computational methods in image processing with
	    applications to medical imaging. Before that, I
	    completed by B.Sc. in Mathematics &amp; Statistics at
	    McMaster Univeristy in Hamilton, Ontario. </p>

	  <p>During the completion of my degrees, I've developed
	  an insatiable need to understand how humans and
	  computers interpret, parse and understand information. I
	  want to know how information can be represented,
	  processed and communicated. To this end, over the past
	  couple years I've researched applied (computational)
	  mathematics, data and image processing, medical imaging,
	  information theory, learning theory and optimization. In
	  addition, undergraduate research exposed me to
	  mathematical biology, computational fluid dynamics and
	  computational statistics.</p>

	  <p>Since September, I've been travelling through North
	  America and Southeast Asia. I recently returned to
	  Toronto, Canada, but the wanderlust persists.
