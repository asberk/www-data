	    Signal and image processing
	  </h3>

	  <p> Researchers &mdash; in industry and academia alike
	    &mdash; rely on the ability to manipulate
	    empirically-acquired image data to give meaningful
	    interpretation to experimental and numerical
	    results. Further, a market exists in which consumers
	    must send and receive information at very fast rates
	    and with imperceptible loss in quality. With
	    ever-increasing data sizes, and ever-improving methods
	    of data acquisition, efficacious methods for data
	    storage, retrieval, communication, processing,
	    analysis and representation are imperative. 
	  </p>

	  <p> Most recently, I have worked in problems related to
	    the perceptual representation of data &mdash; from
	    stratifying the levels of detail in an image/signal to
	    de-noising, de-convolution, segmentation,
	    classification and in-painting. Connections with these
	    problems have been shown in terms of Learning
	    problems, and accurately classifying and predicting
	    outcomes using large datasets. Examples of the above
	    are given in
	    my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/aam54pap8ghfdp2/berkas-res-final.pdf?dl=0">M.Sc. project
	    document</a>.
	  </p>

	  <h3> 
	    Geophysical problems
	  </h3>

	  <p> Accurately determining and predicting climate change
	    and weather patterns is of utmost importance for
	    sustaining economic growth, wildlife diversity and
	    human life. For example, the devastation caused by
	    tsunamis is of constant concern to coastal regions
	    around the world. Results from tidal flow simulations
	    are useful in determining patterns of wave flow and
	    dispersion, having applications to barrier and
	    structural design for the prevention of damage caused
	    by tidal events. Moreover, tools developed in climate
	    modelling have important applications in other areas
	    of mathematics, in economics, and computer vision.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I have worked on problems directly related to
	    realistic simulations of tidal flow. Due to the
	    immensity of scales that persist in tidal flow, it is
	    important to develop a means by which to accurately
	    represent all scales while minimizing resultant
	    computational complexity. In spite of this,
	    simulations are often still extremely computationally
	    demanding. Wavelets and level set methods are two
	    important examples of the kinds of tools used in
	    geophysical applications.
	  </p>

	  <h3> 
	    Mathematical biology
	  </h3>

	  <p> Important for human health &mdash; whether at the
	    population level, concerned with the spread of disease
	    between human beings or among children; or at the
	    level of the cell, concerned with cell growth and
	    tissue morphology.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I have worked on problems relating to the metastatic
	    potential of tumour cell cohorts when subject to a
	    chemotactic enzyme gradient, having suggested that
	    tumour cell cohorts are more likely to metastasize
	    when there exists an apparent enzyme gradient to which
	    the cancerous cells are attracted.
	  </p>
	  <p> Additionally, I have worked on problems relating to
	    epidemiology and population ecology. I have used
	    SHARCNET to optimize statistical models of plant
	    distributions by using lare-scale sparse datasets of
	    heterskedastic seed and seedling distribution to fit
	    spatial auto-correlation functions to the dispersal
	    patterns. In addition I have used stochastic and
	    deterministic techniques to simulate a spatial SIR
	    model of human disease epidemics.
